# ConnectedCare â€“ Healthcare IoT Application

**Smart, accessible health monitoring powered by IoT and voice-first design.**

## ðŸ§  Project Vision

ConnectedCare began as part of my Bachelor's in IT (Web & Software Development), developed for an Interaction Design course focused on applying UI/UX principles to real-world challenges. The project was delivered in three parts:

- Business Case Study
- Analysis Report
- Prototype and Evaluation Report

Rather than a traditional presentation, I built a [project landing page](https://github.com/NabuTech/Healthcare_IoT_App_Project)  to showcase the concept interactively.

From the early stages, it became clear that this was more than just an assignment. I saw potential in the idea and chose to continue developing it beyond graduation. What you're seeing now is a refined, real-world evolution of that original vision â€” a healthcare-focused IoT platform driven by accessibility, usability, and meaningful technology

ConnectedCare is a remote health monitoring platform designed to empower users â€” especially elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and those managing chronic conditions. It integrates IoT devices with a voice-controlled interface, enabling seamless, real-time access to health data across multiple platforms (smart TVs, smartphones, and more).

Our goal is to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and inclusive design by creating a scalable, user-centric system that supports independent living and delivers real-time health insights.

## ðŸ’¡ Concept Statement

The ConnectedCare system uses a micro-server (such as a Raspberry Pi) as a central hub to collect and process data from health-focused IoT sensors. The platform prioritizes intuitive, voice-first interaction and offers access across a range of devices, accommodating diverse user needs. By combining assistive technology with real-time monitoring, ConnectedCare aims to be a trustworthy, accessible, and easy-to-use health portal.
