# Project Objectives

The ConnectedCare platform is guided by the following objectives:

- **Empower users** with disabilities, chronic conditions, or age-related challenges to manage their health from home.
- **Enable voice-first interaction** to improve usability for users with limited mobility or technical literacy.
- **Support cross-device access**, allowing interaction from smartphones, tablets, or smart TVs.
- **Ensure real-time, accurate data collection** from IoT devices without requiring complex setup.
- **Design for inclusivity and dignity**, making users feel in control, not surveilled.
- **Lay the foundation for modular future expansions**, such as caregiver dashboards and advanced analytics.
