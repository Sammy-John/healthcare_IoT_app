# Business Case 

ConnectedCare addresses a growing global need for remote, accessible healthcare solutions — particularly among aging populations, individuals with chronic conditions, and people with disabilities. Traditional healthcare systems often struggle to provide regular monitoring and personalized support without overwhelming clinical resources or requiring users to travel frequently.

The core idea behind ConnectedCare is to provide **non-invasive, voice-controlled, and user-friendly access to personal health data** using Internet of Things (IoT) devices and a micro-server (e.g., Raspberry Pi). This empowers individuals to monitor their well-being from home, while caregivers and health professionals can receive timely updates for informed interventions.

ConnectedCare stands apart by combining **real-time data collection**, **cross-platform compatibility**, and a **focus on dignity and accessibility**, filling a critical gap in current health tech offerings.

The key driving motivations behind this project is the goal of enabling people to **remain in their own homes longer**, rather than transitioning prematurely to assisted living or long-term care facilities. Staying at home is often associated with better mental well-being, autonomy, and quality of life — particularly for individuals facing cognitive decline, mobility challenges, or social isolation. By providing unobtrusive tools for health and behavior monitoring, ConnectedCare supports both safety and independence in a familiar environment.

**Reducing the burden on the healthcare system by supporting remote monitoring.**
